# ElasticTime

ElasticTime (v3) is an experimental form of time that helps us align with natural cycles of the sun.  It seeks to create a paralell proportional personal time based upon your geolocation.  There are two periods of natural time, day-time and night-time.  This version of elastic time uses your location to divide day and night into 100 blocks with 100 moments in each block.  ElasticTime is a natural alternative to our universal, logistical time that we use to manage our schedules.  What if you could exist first in your time, but show up when people need you?  How might that encourage each of us to create time and space for one another?
