# ElasticTime

ElasticTime is an experimental web app that is extremely simple.  Its about using technology to create our own experience of time.  This version of elastic time uses your location to divide day and night into 50 moments (100 total time periods each day, regardless of the time of year).
 
The long term goal is to extend its functionality to connect with my calendar and translate my appointments and reminders so I can exist in my own time rules.
